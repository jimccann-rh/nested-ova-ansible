# nested-ovf-ansible
Create a dynamic vsphere setup (using dhcp)

You will need a server to host your ovf files via http. I suggest: https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve or you could use a s3 bucket.

I got my ESXi ova from Willaim Lam (just google)
I got my vCenter ova from the vCenter install ISO (download from vmware)

look at file runitall.sh for examples on how to run
